Using CPython 3.10.19 interpreter at: /usr/local/bin/python
warning: No `requires-python` value found in the workspace. Defaulting to `>=3.10`.
  × No solution found when resolving dependencies for split (markers:
  │ python_full_version == '3.10.*'):
  ╰─▶ Because the requested Python version (>=3.10) does not satisfy
      Python>=3.11,<4.0 and deepagents>=0.3.0 depends on Python>=3.11,<4.0, we
      can conclude that deepagents>=0.3.0 cannot be used.
      And because only the following versions of deepagents are available:
          deepagents<=0.3.0
          deepagents==0.3.1
      and your project depends on deepagents>=0.3.0, we can conclude that your
      project's requirements are unsatisfiable.

      hint: `deepagents` was found on https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple,
      but not at the requested version (all of:
          deepagents>0.3.0,<0.3.1
          deepagents>0.3.1
      ). A compatible version may be available on a subsequent index (e.g.,
      https://pypi.org/simple). By default, uv will only consider versions
      that are published on the first index that contains a given package, to
      avoid dependency confusion attacks. If all indexes are equally trusted,
      use `--index-strategy unsafe-best-match` to consider all versions from
      all indexes, regardless of the order in which they were defined.

      hint: The `requires-python` value (>=3.10) includes Python versions
      that are not supported by your dependencies (e.g., deepagents>=0.3.0
      only supports >=3.11, <4.0). Consider using a more restrictive
      `requires-python` value (like >=3.11, <4.0).
